- The data patchwork is base on the hundred phone numbers around a random student.

```
	Next step :

		• Add a field to create your own color algorythm
```

### 2# An app base on Ethereum blockchain
- The utility goal is to see the 100 last block
- It is also a good pedagogical app to see how ethereum blocks are différent.

```
	Next step :
		• Add a form to find a specific block
		• Change the color algorythm
		• Add some filter to choose the base data to generate colors
		• Add a field to create your own color algorythm
```
